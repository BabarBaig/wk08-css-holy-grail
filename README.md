"The holy grail is a web page layout which has multiple, equal height columns that are defined with style sheets. It is commonly desired and implemented, but for many years, the various ways in which it could be implemented with available technologies all had drawbacks.[1] Because of this, finding an optimal implementation was likened to searching for the elusive Holy Grail."

A web page is like a stool with 3 legs:

1. HTML, which provides the scaffolding for the web page
2. CSS, which provides the styling and visual appeal
3. JavaScript, which makes the page dynamic and engaging

CSS has been through multiple iterations to help make it better at giving styling control over a web page with fewer lines of code.  In recent iterations, it enables a grid-style visualization of the web page, and gives us control over how the grid looks, with minimal code.
