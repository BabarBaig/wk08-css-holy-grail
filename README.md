# wk08-css-grid

A web page is like a stool with 3 legs:
1. HTML, which provides the scaffolding for the web page
2. CSS, which provides the styling and visual appeal
3. JavaScript, which makes the page dynamic and engaging

CSS has been through multiple iterations to help make it better at giving styling control over a web page with fewer lines of code.  In recent iterations, it enables a grid-style visualization of the web page, and gives us control over how the grid looks, with minimal code.
